  - Discuss data normalization needs and techniques

2. Basics of Databases, and SQL
  - Concepts

3. Relationships in SQL / SQL JOINs
  - Define what a foreign key is
  - Describe how to represent a one-to-many relationship in SQL database
  - Explain how to represent one-to-one and many-to-many relationships in a SQL DB
